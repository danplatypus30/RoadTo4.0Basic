                    During my year 2 of studies, we had this module which required us to create
                    our own project, using C#, without much help from the teachers.
                    I had no experience in this and learning it on my own was really difficult,
                    because we had to juggle this with our other modules as well. Luckily for me,
                    with the help of my seniors and friends who knew how to code using the asp .net framework,
                    I managed to learn the basics quickly, enough for me to research the more advanced functions
                    by myself.
                    <br><br>
                    Then I thought, what about my peers, what about those who did not have help from seniors or friends?
                    It isn't easy to 'research and learn' a new framework by yourself, even though many have done it,
                    but what about those who aren't strong technically? So I thought, back then, what I really needed most
                    was actually a detailed example, a guide to start with the basics of this. Honestly, as much as there
                    are many guides out there, many of them are meant for technically inclined people, and beginner guides
                    tend to miss out explanations here and there too.
                    <br><br>
                    So I decided to come up with this project, where comprehensive guides and tutorials could be uploaded,
                    there will be a forums for people to ask questions, just like StackOverflow. And also options for students
                    to arrange appointments with seniors for help. The targeted audience of this project is students in polytechnics
                    and universities, currently studying Computer Science. And I plan to expand this to other sectors as well, such as
                    those in Engineering, Interactive Design and Media, Chemical Life Sciences if possible. But it will definitely be a
                    "for students" page, though still accessible to the public, enough for freelancers to pick up new frameworks too.

                    Hi! I'm Daniel, the team leader of this project.
                    <br><br>
                    I am currently studying Diploma of Cyber Security and Forensics, going to year 3.
                    <br><br>
                    I am an easy-going person, who loves hanging out with friends.
                    <br><br>
                    My hobbies include dance, street dance to be more exact, or popping to be even more exact.
                    I also love to play the guitar. And generally, I enjoy most kind of sports.
                    <br><br>
                    I am pretty interested in ethical hacking, forensics,
                     cloud technologies and website development.

                    <br>
                    I love to meet new people with common interests with me, as well as attending events and activities that are relevant to my life goals.
                    <br>
                    I like to spend my free time listening to music, or even mixing music, as it helps me relax.
                    <br>
                    Sometimes, it's also food for thought for me to brainstorm new ideas or to power up my day as I'm a caffeine free person.
                    <br>
                    I love to help as well as give advice or counselling to anyone that is in dire need of support or assistance.
